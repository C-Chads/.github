# The C Chads

## Who are we?
The C-Chads is an open group of programmers and computer CHADS dedicated to collecting and creating free software, especially in C

## Can I join?
Yes. Submit an issue on our [group constitution](https://github.com/C-Chads/C-Chads)

## All this stuff is free?
Yes! Some of it is even public domain.

## Can I contribute?
Of course! Make PRs or start/fork repos into the organization.

It has to be free, though, obviously.
We place a special emphasis on public domain code, but any FOSS license is alright.

## What do I need to be a meaningful contributor?
1. *nix development environment with shell. Msys2 or WSL might work if you're on windows, but honestly why would you use windows anyway
2. A C compiler, or the tools to develop in the language/platform you are working with. C is obviously our thing.
3. Skills: can you actually code?

## Do you have an inclusive pro-diversity political statement?
No, That stuff is stupid and for weak pathetic soydev nerds who write rust on windows
instead, we have a highly exclusive anti-inclusivity anti-diversity TOS which prohibits soydevery

* if you post pictures of your programming socks or your anime bodypillow then you're totally out of the group
* if you think that Rust is better than C then you're also out of the group
* if you have pronouns in your bio or on your profile then you're sentenced to life in prison
